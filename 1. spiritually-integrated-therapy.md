# Integrated Mental Health Care

## Defining Spiritually Integrated Therapy 

“Spiritually integrated psychotherapy involves the use of clients’ spiritual or religious beliefs as resources to help accomplish the goals of therapy -- relief of depression, anxiety, and other forms of emotional distress. It is an approach to treatment that is broad enough to address the mental health needs of those who are spiritual but not religious, as well as those of clients who are both spiritual and religious. "

## Why Integrate Spirituality into Therapy?

*First*, religion is a cultural fact. 

*Second*, research shows that people turn to religion to cope with life stressors. And it’s effective! Spirituality helps people manage stress and find meaning during challenging times. Spirituality is also associated with an increased sense of purpose, resilience, satisfaction, and happiness. This is particularly true for people with limited resources such as minorities, the elderly, and the poor who are dealing with uncontrollable life situations

*Third*, many of our clients are spiritual and they want professional help that is sensitive to their faith. Among depressed adults with a chronic medical illness, more than three quarters want their spiritual beliefs incorporated into therapy. In both of these latter studies, clients stated that the practitioner should be the one to initiate the conversation.

*Fourth*, many empirical studies show that spirituality is linked to positive physical and mental health outcomes. After an extensive literature review, Koenig, King, and Carson (2012) concluded that religious involvement is correlated with all of these:

- Well-being, happiness and life satisfaction
- Less anxiety
- Lower rates of suicide
- Lower rates of depression and faster recovery
- Less psychosis
- Lower rates of alcohol and drug use
- Less delinquency and criminal activity
- Greater marital stability and satisfaction

Religious involvement is associated with lower rates of depression and faster recovery from depression, lower rates of suicide and fewer positive attitudes toward suicide, less anxiety, less psychosis and fewer psychotic tendencies, lower rates of alcohol and drug use or abuse, and less delinquency and criminal activity.


*Fifth*, spirituality is often associated with positive health outcomes, but sometimes it can be part of the problem. Research shows that some forms of spirituality are associated with poorer physical and mental health outcomes. It’s important to be aware of spiritual problems because they are linked to increased likelihood of major depression and anxiety disorders, moral injury among veterans and greater use of mental health services (Fontana & Rosenheck, 2004), poor physical health outcomes, poorer quality of life, greater burden and less satisfaction among caregivers (Pearce et al., 2006), and predict a 22-33% greater risk of mortality over a two year period  in medically ill elderly patients, after controlling for other variables (Pargament, Koenig, Tarakeshwar, & Hahn, 2004). So it’s clear that both positive and dysfunctional forms of religious and spiritual involvement are important for therapists to recognize and address.

The *sixth* reason for practicing spiritually integrated therapy is that spirituality cannot be separated from the treatment process. We really can't be neutral about spirituality or any other issue. Some studies have shown that the values of the therapist shape the outcome of psychotherapy.  Patients tend to move towards the values of the therapist over the course of treatment, even when they are engaged in treatment with experienced psychodynamic or patient-centered therapists.  The danger in trying to leave our values at the door is that we don't recognize the subtle ways our values impact on treatment.  

*Seventh*, spiritual integration is tied to treatment effectiveness. A client is more likely to follow through on an intervention when it aligns with her worldview and values. Indeed, interventions that line up with clients’ spiritual beliefs and values have the potential to speed recovery, improve psychological outcomes, and prevent relapse (Hodge, 2016). 

## Spiritual and Religious Competence as a Form of Multicultural Competence

Spiritual competence has been defined as “a form of cultural competence that deals with spirituality and religion, specifically clients’ individually constructed spiritual worldviews” .

The three basic activities of multicultural competence are as follows: (1) to engage in the process of becoming aware of one’s own assumptions about human behavior, values, biases, preconceived notions, personal limitations, and so forth; (2) to attempt to understand the worldview of culturally different clients without judgment; (3) to implement relevant, and sensitive intervention strategies with culturally different clients.

### Spiritually Competent Attitudes

The first thing practitioners need in order to deliver spiritually competent therapy is a certain set of attitudes. By attitudes we mean the implicit (nonconscious) and explicit (conscious) perspectives, assumptions, and/or biases people hold about spirituality and religion as they relate to the practice of psychology.

Research has shown (O’Connor & Vandenberg, 2005; Ruff, 2008) that psychotherapists can tend to unintentionally diagnose people who are religious with more psychopathology than those who are not religious (when assessing vignettes where the only case information changed was the religion of the client).



- Demonstrating respect, empathy, and appreciation for clients from diverse spiritual and religious backgrounds
- Appreciating religious and spiritual diversity
- Awareness of how one’s own spiritual or religious background and beliefs may influence one’s clinical practice.

### Spiritually Competent Knowledge

The second thing practitioners need in order to deliver spiritually competent therapy is a foundational knowledge base. By knowledge we mean information, facts, concepts, and awareness of research literature that therapists should possess about spirituality and religion as it relates to mental health. Some examples of the things that are important for practitioners to know are as follows:

- The similarities and differences between spirituality and religion
- How to determine the difference between spirituality and psychopathology
- How and why spirituality can be a resource for clients
- How and why spirituality can be harmful for clients

### Spiritually Competent Skills

Finally, the third thing practitioners need in order to deliver spiritually competent therapy is a set of specific skills. Here we are referring to therapists’ ability to effectively utilize their knowledge of spirituality and religion in their actual interventions and clinical work with clients. A few of these skills include,

- Assessing clients’ religion and/or spirituality in reference to their mental health
- Helping clients access and mobilize any spiritual and/or religious resources they may have.
- Helping clients identify and resolve spiritual and religious problems affecting their mental health
- Recognizing and acknowledging your limits, and knowing how to make referrals to clergy, religious leaders, and spiritual caregivers
