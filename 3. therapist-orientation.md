Clinician's Diary: Susan's Spiritual Experience

The following clinical account is taken from the work of a psychiatrist, Dr. James Lomax et al., (2011, p. 2). Dr. Lomax was conducting psychotherapy with a patient, “Susan,” a secular physician, whose mentor, Dr. Brown was dying.   Susan visited her mentor before she went on vacation knowing he was dying.  She describes her spiritual experience to Dr. Lomax. As you read the following account, listen to the way Dr. Lomax responds to Susan.  How do you think she feels about his response? How do you feel about his response?

Patient: Yes, and here’s something weirder and I’m not sure I can talk about this. [Begins to cry] You know I felt very close to Dr. Brown. Before he died, we all knew he had cancer. Another member of our section also had metastatic cancer. He and I were talking about his relapse, but he said that, at least for him, the treatments were working. After that talk, I went right away to talk to Dr. Brown. I wanted him to know how much he meant to me. Actually, he spent most of that time comforting me! At the end, I told him I loved him and gave him a kiss on the cheek. He gave me a kiss back and said that he loved me also. As I left, I tried to help him with his chair. He laughed and said, “I’m not dead yet!”

Then on August 9 I was in Alaska with my fiancé. I didn’t have e-mail access. About 2:00 p.m. that day, close to the time when Dr. Brown was dying in Houston, we were dog sledding out on a glacier with nothing but snow around us. I got off the sled and it felt like he was standing next to me. I felt him and heard something like his voice inside me saying: “Yes, I’ve died, but I love you. I will always love you, and you will do well.” Of course I began to cry just like I am now, but I got back on the sled to finish the ride. I didn’t say much of anything to my fiancé. I was concerned he would think it was too weird. Other people were teary because of the wind and snow, but that wasn’t what was happening for me. We got on a helicopter and eventually returned to the cruise ship.

The next day, I called my mother. She began the phone conversation by asking “if I had heard.” I said, “Yes, I heard.” She confirmed when he died, right before I had that experience. I still couldn’t talk about it to anyone. [This event had happened months previously.]

After the ship arrived in Anchorage, my fiancé and I took a trip to Denali National Park. Mount McKinley is famous because it can be so difficult to see the top of the mountain. When we got there, the mountain of course was covered in clouds. I stood there and asked Dr. Brown to move the clouds off the mountain as a sign to me that he was all right. Of course, nothing happened immediately, but 2 hours later, the clouds cleared for 3 whole days. Everyone there said they had never seen anything like it. For me, that was very special.

Therapist: That was very special indeed.

Patient: [Crying a bit more intensely] I have never told anyone about this until now. Those moments will always be special to me.

Therapist: They should be. It’s a very beautiful love story.

Patient: It’s also surprising to me. Does this routinely happen?

Therapist: The sort of love that you had with Dr. Brown is hardly routine.

Patient: [Crying a bit more heavily] But do other people have experiences like this with people who have died?

Therapist: Only if they are extremely lucky. . .

Patient: [Getting up from the couch and smiling, though still with a lot of tears] I’ll probably cry the rest of the afternoon. Thank you for letting me tell you this. I may even tell my fiancé now.

Therapist: Stories like this get richer when told in safe relationships to the right person. Clearly today has been a major step, and probably both of us are thinking about how you started the session with the protest that you didn’t have much to say.

[Patient chuckles] Something like this is, of course, incredibly important. Try to capture whatever this session does inside you and bring it back so we can know about it together.

Patient: [Nods] “Thank you very much.” [Leaves]

## Spiritual Self-Awareness

We need greater awareness of our own world views to facilitate dialog in therapy.
What impacts our own spirituality?

ex. Don't talk about fundamentalism.
ex. Don't minimize the doubts about a religious patient to start meditation practices

Be aware of:

- how your world view has been shaped by spiritual influence
- foster greater clinical atunement
- identify and reduce clinical biases
