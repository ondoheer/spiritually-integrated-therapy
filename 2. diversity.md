# Understanding Spirituality

## Religious and Spiritual Diversity

Spirituality, as we have noted, is very much concerned about the sacred.  In particular, it is concerned with the sacred destinations people seek in life and the sacred pathways they take to get there.  Sacred destinations are ultimate concerns, the powerful magnets in life that lure us forward. They are also diverse.  People can find a higher purpose in many aspects of life.  We see some examples in the table, below.  It’s important  to note that people don’t pick  out only one of these destinations.  Instead, they create configurations of  sacred destinations.  These configurations are very individualized and, in fact, contribute to what makes each person unique.

### Sacred Destinations and Pathways

- To grow as a person 	
- To find peace

- To eliminate injustice 	
- To be less self-centered
- To find truth 	
- To find my purpose in life 	
- To control my temper
- To feel connected 
- to others 	
- To have a closer relation with God 	
- To live a moral life
- To fight idolatry 	
- To be the best I can be 	
- To be more forgiving
- To share my faith with others 	
- To be filled with joy 	
- To be one with the universe
- To be healthy 	
- To be fully aware 	
- To be a better parent and spouse
- To make the world a better place 	
- To straighten out my values 	
- To stand up for underdogs
- To avoid sinning 	
- To be more compassionate 	
- To tune in
- to a higher power more regularly

There is no shortage  of alternative pathways people can take to the sacred.  Part of the power of religion and spirituality is that they allow for people with diverse needs and preferences to find or build their own preferred pathways.

When we combine spiritual pathways with spiritual destinations we create spiritual orientations to life.  Here too we find diversity.  Three spiritual orientations have received the most attention: intrinsic, extrinsic, and quest (Allport, 1950; Batson et al., 1993). In an intrinsic orientation, spirituality is the central organizing force in the individual’s life.  The faith is broad and deep, designed to achieve sacred connection. An extrinsic spiritual orientation is lightly held, a peripheral part of life, one that serves non-spiritual purposes, such as social status. A quest orientation reflects a questioning, flexible approach to spirituality that is designed to facilitate meaning, truth, and self-development.

### Four Forces that Shape Spiritual Development
The process of spiritual development does not occur in a vacuum.  It is shaped by a variety of forces.   Let's review four forces that shape spiritual development:

- Biological
- Social
- Psychological
- Situational
